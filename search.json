This course emphasizes analytical skills, systems thinking, communication, and teamwork.\nThe course aims to provide:\n\nan understanding of the scope of civil and environmental engineering;\nan understanding of the academic activities of the Rice CEVE department;\nexposure to fundamental principles, concepts, and approaches that apply across CEVE disciplines, including quantitative reasoning and creative problem solving;\na context for applying information from other first-year courses, especially calculus and physics;\na background for higher level classes in civil and environmental engineering;\nan appreciation for the many links between the practice of civil and environmental engineering and social goals including sustainability, resilience, and equity;\na sampling of possible career paths within the field of civil and environmental engineering, and their requirements;\nand some experience with the fun of being an engineer.\n\nOn completing this course, students should be able to:\n\nIdentify civil and environmental engineering subfields\nSuccessfully perform engineering problem solving in several civil and environmental subfields\nGenerate report-quality engineering calculations\nCreate and present an oral report on a design project\nCollaborate with peers in project teams and in composing project reports\n\n\n\nRequired Materials\nNo textbook is required for this course. All materials will be posted as open source on the course website or on Canvas.\nYou will occasionally be assigned scientific papers to read. Where those are available through the Rice library, you will be expected to access them yourself. You are encouraged, though not required, to use Zotero (Rice students have free storage).

    "section": "A Community of Learning",
    "text": "A Community of Learning\nRice’s core values are responsibility, integrity, community, and excellence. Our goal is to create a learning community aligned with these core values.\n\nCore Expectations\nCourse success involves a dual responsibility on the part of the instructor and the student.\n\n\nAs the instructor, my responsibility is to provide you with a structure and opportunity to learn. To this end, I commit to:\n\nprovide organized and focused lectures, in-class activities, and assignments;\nencourage students to regularly evaluate and provide feedback on the course;\nmanage the classroom atmosphere to promote learning;\nschedule sufficient out-of-class contact opportunities, such as office hours;\nallow adequate time for assignment completion;\nmake lecture materials, class policies, activities, and assignments accessible to students.\n\n\n\n\nStudents are responsible for their own learning in the course and should commit to:\n\nattending all lectures;\ndoing all required preparatory work before class;\nactively participating in online and in-class discussions;\nbeginning assignments and other work early; and\nattending office hours as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat If I’m Sick?\n\n\n\nPlease stay home if you’re feeling sick! This is beneficial for both for your own recovery and the health and safety of your classmates. We will also make any necessary arrangements for you to stay on top of the class material and if whatever is going on will negatively impact your grade, for example by causing you to be unable to submit an assignment on time.\n\n\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nRice is committed to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at Rice, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.\nEach of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.\n\n\nAccommodation for Students with Disabilities\nIf you have a documented disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should: 1) make sure this documentation is on file with the Disability Resource Center (Allen Center, Room 111 / adarice@rice.edu / x5841) to determine the accommodations you need; and 2) talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs.\n\n\nAccommodation for Scheduling Conflicts\nIf any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, student athletics, or other non-negotiable scheduling conflict, please let me know ASAP so that we can make arrangements for you.\n\n\nGetting Help\nYou can ask questions through Canvas Discussions and Office Hours. We will make an effort to respond to all Canvas discussion questions within 24 hours, though this won’t always be possible (travel, weekends, etc.). Please do not use email for questions about course content or labs, since other students may have related questions. You should use email for questions about personal matters, such as scheduling conflicts, accommodations, etc.",

    "section": "Academic Integrity",
    "text": "Academic Integrity\nThis class is designed to encourage collaboration, and students are encouraged to discuss their work with other students. Engineering as a profession relies upon the honesty and integrity of its practitioners (see e.g. the American Society for Civil Engineers’ Code of Ethics). All work submitted must represent the students’ own work and understanding, whether individually or as a group (depending on the particulars of the assignment).\nIf you are ever unclear about academic integrity, please ask! Additionally, always err on the side of providing more information.)\n\nRice Honor Code\nMore specifically, all students will be held to the standards of the Rice Honor Code, a code that you pledged to honor when you matriculated at this institution. If you are unfamiliar with the details of this code and how it is administered, you should consult the Honor System Handbook at honor.rice.edu/honor-system-handbook/. This handbook outlines the University’s expectations for the integrity of your academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.\n\n\nAI/ML Resource Policy\nLarge language models (LLMs), like GPT, are powerful tools for generating text that can be used for coding and doing data analysis. This is at once empowering (LLMs are powerful and can save you time) and risky (LLMs can make mistakes that are hard to detect).\nOur general view is that LLMs are powerful tools that you will encounter and use when you leave this classroom, so it’s important to learn how to use them responsibly and effectively. You are generally permitted to use LLMs in this course, but ultimately, you are responsible for guaranteeing, understanding, and interpreting your results. In particular:\n\nOne of the best applications of LLMs is to write code. This can help accelerate your workflow, especially when you are learning new syntax. However, LLMs can make bad decisions about how to structure your code, can introduce bugs, and can mislead you about what your code is doing. You are responsible for understanding and debugging your code, and for ensuring that it does what you intend it to do.\nLLMs should not be used to generate text that you submit as your own work. If you are assigned a writing assignment, the point is to stimulate your thought process, and you short-cut this if you ask a LLM to generate the response for you. This leads to shallow thinking! However, you may use tools including LLMs (but also Grammarly, spell-check, etc.) to help you edit your writing. This can sometimes be a fine line; it’s always better to ask if you’re not sure, and to disclose your use of these tools in your submission\n\n\n\nPolicy on Web Posting of Course Materials\nUploading course materials to web sites is not an authorized use of the course material. Both the poster and the user are in violation of the university policy, which is actionable.",
