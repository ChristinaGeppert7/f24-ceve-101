    "text": "A Community of Learning\nRice’s core values are responsibility, integrity, community, and excellence. Our goal is to create a learning community aligned with these core values.\n\nCore Expectations\nCourse success involves a dual responsibility on the part of the instructor and the student.\n\n\nAs the instructor, I am responsible for providing you with a structure and opportunity to learn, including:\n\nprovide organized and focused lectures, in-class activities, and assignments;\nencourage students to regularly evaluate and provide feedback on the course;\nmanage the classroom atmosphere to promote learning;\nschedule sufficient out-of-class contact opportunities, such as office hours;\nallow adequate time for assignment completion;\nmake lecture materials, class policies, activities, and assignments accessible to students.\n\n\n\n\nStudents are responsible for their own learning in the course and should commit to:\n\nattending all lectures;\ndoing all required preparatory work before class;\nactively participating in online and in-class discussions;\nbeginning assignments and other work early; and\nattending office hours as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nRice is committed to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at Rice, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.\n\n\nAccommodations\n\nStudents with Disabilities\nIf you have a documented disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should: 1) make sure this documentation is on file with the Disability Resource Center (Allen Center, Room 111 / adarice@rice.edu / x5841) to determine the accommodations you need; and 2) talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs.\n\n\nScheduling Conflicts\nIf any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, student athletics, or other non-negotiable scheduling conflict, please let me know ASAP so that we can make arrangements for you.\n\n\n\nGetting Help\nYou can ask questions through Canvas Discussions and Office Hours. We will make an effort to respond to all Canvas discussion questions within 24 hours, though this won’t always be possible (travel, weekends, etc.). Please do not use email for questions about course content or labs, since other students may have related questions. You should use email for questions about personal matters, such as scheduling conflicts, accommodations, etc.",

    "section": "Academic Integrity",
    "text": "Academic Integrity\nThis class is designed to encourage collaboration, and students are encouraged to discuss their work with other students. Engineering as a profession relies upon the honesty and integrity of its practitioners (see e.g. the American Society for Civil Engineers’ Code of Ethics). All work submitted must represent the students’ own work and understanding, whether individually or as a group (depending on the particulars of the assignment).\nIf you are ever unclear about academic integrity, please ask! Additionally, always err on the side of providing more information.)\n\nRice Honor Code\nMore specifically, all students will be held to the standards of the Rice Honor Code, a code that you pledged to honor when you matriculated at this institution. If you are unfamiliar with the details of this code and how it is administered, you should consult the Honor System Handbook at honor.rice.edu/honor-system-handbook/. This handbook outlines the University’s expectations for the integrity of your academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.\n\n\nAI/ML Resource Policy\nLarge language models (LLMs), like GPT, are powerful tools for generating text that can be used for coding and doing data analysis. This is at once empowering (LLMs are powerful and can save you time) and risky (LLMs can make mistakes that are hard to detect).\nOur general view is that LLMs are powerful tools that you will encounter and use when you leave this classroom, so it’s important to learn how to use them responsibly and effectively. You are generally permitted to use LLMs in this course, but ultimately, you are responsible for guaranteeing, understanding, and interpreting your results. In particular:\n\nOne of the best applications of LLMs is to write code. This can help accelerate your workflow, especially when you are learning new syntax. However, LLMs can make bad decisions about how to structure your code, can introduce bugs, and can mislead you about what your code is doing. You are responsible for understanding and debugging your code, and for ensuring that it does what you intend it to do.\nLLMs should not be used to generate text that you submit as your own work. If you are assigned a writing assignment, the point is to stimulate your thought process, and you short-cut this if you ask a LLM to generate the response for you. This leads to shallow thinking! However, you may use tools including LLMs (but also Grammarly, spell-check, etc.) to help you edit your writing. This can sometimes be a fine line; it’s always better to ask if you’re not sure, and to disclose your use of these tools in your submission",

The course will be split into four modules, each weighted equally (10 points for participation and 15 for a project).\n\nParticipation\nParticipation is essential to this course. To earn full points for participation, you should attend class in-person, do assigned readings, and participate in class (you will be provided with multiple ways to share your thoughts in class beyond raising your hand and speaking). All readings will be posted on the course website and announced in class. Occasional pop quizzes on reading will factor into your participation grade.\nParticipation will be assessed for each module, and both students and I will provide feedback. Your lowest module participation grade will be dropped.\n\n\nProjects\nEach module of the course will culminate in a group design project. Specific instructions and a detailed rubric will be provided for each project at the time of assignment. These rubrics will outline the expectations for the project and how it will be evaluated.\nGroup work will be assessed through a combination of the final product and peer evaluations. Each team member will confidentially evaluate their peers’ contributions, which will factor into individual grades for group projects.\nLate projects will be subjected to a 10% penalty per day.",

    "text": "Rural commmunities around the world struggle to access clean water, especially in arid and semi-arid regions where water is scarce. In Northeastern Brazil, many communities rely on a combination of deep wells (which are expensive to access and often yield saline water) and shallow surface reservoirs (which often dry up during dry years). In response, the federal government of Brazil launched a program (Projeto 1 Milhão de Cisternas – One Million Cisterns Project) to promote rainwater to capture water during the rainy season and store it for use during the dry season. The project also aimed to build local economies through use of local materials and construction techniques.\nWhile the project has been successful in many ways, it has also faced challenges. A particular challenge is that during droughts the cisterns may not be fully rechared, leading to inadequate water supply during the dry season.\nIn this project, your group will use climate data, mass-balance techniques, and computer programming to size a rainwater harvesting system for a single house in Northeastern Brazil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther details will be provided.

CEVEs work at the dynamic interface of the built environment, information environment, and natural environment on topics like smart cities and construction, sustainable energy and buildings, connected and automated transportation systems, resilient infrastructure, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and water management. In this course, students will explore how data science, environmental science, economic analysis, structural design, and systems thinking can be integrated to promote sustainability, resilience, and equity. Through a mix of technical lectures, topical seminars on applications and ideas of interest, and team-based projects, students will develop skills in data analysis, system modeling, and engineering design and develop an understanding of the broad field of civil and environmental engineering and its applications.\nFor additional information, see the syllabus.",
