    "text": "A Community of Learning\nRice’s core values are responsibility, integrity, community, and excellence. Our goal is to create a learning community aligned with these core values.\n\nCore Expectations\nCourse success involves a dual responsibility on the part of the instructor and the student.\n\n\nAs the instructor, I am responsible for providing you with a structure and opportunity to learn, including:\n\nprovide organized and focused lectures, in-class activities, and assignments;\nencourage students to regularly evaluate and provide feedback on the course;\nmanage the classroom atmosphere to promote learning;\nschedule sufficient out-of-class contact opportunities, such as office hours;\nallow adequate time for assignment completion;\nmake lecture materials, class policies, activities, and assignments accessible to students.\n\n\n\n\nStudents are responsible for their own learning in the course and should commit to:\n\nattending all lectures;\ndoing all required preparatory work before class;\nactively participating in online and in-class discussions;\nbeginning assignments and other work early; and\nattending office hours as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nRice is committed to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at Rice, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.\n\n\nAccommodations\n\nStudents with Disabilities\nIf you have a documented disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should: 1) make sure this documentation is on file with the Disability Resource Center (Allen Center, Room 111 / adarice@rice.edu / x5841) to determine the accommodations you need; and 2) talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs.\n\n\nScheduling Conflicts\nIf any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, student athletics, or other non-negotiable scheduling conflict, please let me know ASAP so that we can make arrangements for you.\n\n\n\nGetting Help\nYou can ask questions through Canvas Discussions and Office Hours. We will make an effort to respond to all Canvas discussion questions within 24 hours, though this won’t always be possible (travel, weekends, etc.). Please do not use email for questions about course content or labs, since other students may have related questions. You should use email for questions about personal matters, such as scheduling conflicts, accommodations, etc.",

    "section": "Academic Integrity",
    "text": "Academic Integrity\nThis class is designed to encourage collaboration, and students are encouraged to discuss their work with other students. Engineering as a profession relies upon the honesty and integrity of its practitioners (see e.g. the American Society for Civil Engineers’ Code of Ethics). All work submitted must represent the students’ own work and understanding, whether individually or as a group (depending on the particulars of the assignment).\nIf you are ever unclear about academic integrity, please ask! Additionally, always err on the side of providing more information.)\n\nRice Honor Code\nMore specifically, all students will be held to the standards of the Rice Honor Code, a code that you pledged to honor when you matriculated at this institution. If you are unfamiliar with the details of this code and how it is administered, you should consult the Honor System Handbook at honor.rice.edu/honor-system-handbook/. This handbook outlines the University’s expectations for the integrity of your academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.\n\n\nAI/ML Resource Policy\nLarge language models (LLMs), like GPT, are powerful tools for generating text that can be used for coding and doing data analysis. This is at once empowering (LLMs are powerful and can save you time) and risky (LLMs can make mistakes that are hard to detect).\nOur general view is that LLMs are powerful tools that you will encounter and use when you leave this classroom, so it’s important to learn how to use them responsibly and effectively. You are generally permitted to use LLMs in this course, but ultimately, you are responsible for guaranteeing, understanding, and interpreting your results. In particular:\n\nOne of the best applications of LLMs is to write code. This can help accelerate your workflow, especially when you are learning new syntax. However, LLMs can make bad decisions about how to structure your code, can introduce bugs, and can mislead you about what your code is doing. You are responsible for understanding and debugging your code, and for ensuring that it does what you intend it to do.\nLLMs should not be used to generate text that you submit as your own work. If you are assigned a writing assignment, the point is to stimulate your thought process, and you short-cut this if you ask a LLM to generate the response for you. This leads to shallow thinking! However, you may use tools including LLMs (but also Grammarly, spell-check, etc.) to help you edit your writing. This can sometimes be a fine line; it’s always better to ask if you’re not sure, and to disclose your use of these tools in your submission",

The course will be split into four modules, each weighted equally (10 points for participation and 15 for a project).\n\nParticipation\nParticipation is essential to this course. To earn full points for participation, you should attend class in-person, do assigned readings, and participate in class (you will be provided with multiple ways to share your thoughts in class beyond raising your hand and speaking). All readings will be posted on the course website and announced in class. Occasional pop quizzes on reading will factor into your participation grade.\nParticipation will be assessed for each module, and both students and I will provide feedback. Your lowest module participation grade will be dropped.\n\n\nProjects\nEach module of the course will culminate in a group design project. Specific instructions and a detailed rubric will be provided for each project at the time of assignment. These rubrics will outline the expectations for the project and how it will be evaluated.\nGroup work will be assessed through a combination of the final product and peer evaluations. Each team member will confidentially evaluate their peers’ contributions, which will factor into individual grades for group projects.\nLate projects will be subjected to a 10% penalty per day.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Rural commmunities around the world struggle to access clean water, especially in arid and semi-arid regions where water is scarce. In Northeastern Brazil, many communities rely on a combination of deep wells (which are expensive to access and often yield saline water) and shallow surface reservoirs (which often dry up during dry years). In response, the federal government of Brazil launched a program (Projeto 1 Milhão de Cisternas – One Million Cisterns Project) to promote rainwater to capture water during the rainy season and store it for use during the dry season. The project also aimed to build local economies through use of local materials and construction techniques.\nWhile the project has been successful in many ways, it has also faced challenges. A particular challenge is that during droughts the cisterns may not be fully rechared, leading to inadequate water supply during the dry season.\nIn this project, you will use climate data, mass-balance techniques, and computer programming to size a rainwater harvesting system for a single house in Northeastern Brazil. For further discussion of the model and parameters, see Doss-Gollin et al. (2015) (note: language is occasionally clunky – lots of terms that I learned in Portuguese before I learned them in English, and translated poorly. Learning is a continuous process!)."

    "section": "Toolkit: Overview",
    "text": "Toolkit: Overview\nAs discussed in class, we will use a range of computational tools to complete this project.\n\nJulia\nWe’re using the Julia programming language in this course. Julia is a fast, modern, open-source programming language designed for numerical and scientific computing.\nWe’re using it for a few key reasons. First, the syntax is human-readable and closely parallels math notation, which reduces the cognitive burden of translating between conceptual and computational models. Second, it’s fast, which means that Julia solves the “two language problem”: you don’t need to learn C or Fortran to dig under the hood and write fast code. Other great features include that it’s open-source, which makes it reproducible and shareable, and it has a fantastic package manager.\nThere are some great resources out there about why Julia is great. See posts by Julia Data Science or the Julia Creators (with followup).\n\n\nGitHub\ngit is a software tool for version control that keeps track of changes to files over time. GitHub is a website that hosts git repositories and provides a web interface for interacting with them.\nTo use GitHub, you’ll need a GitHub account. Code on GitHub is stored in repositories. A simple workflow is to clone a repository to your computer, make changes, commit them, then push your changes to GitHub.\nWe will also use GitHub classroom, which allows instructors to share templates and view your code.\n\n\nQuarto\nQuarto is a tool that allows you to combine text and code and create many types of output. For example, this website is made with Quarto! You will use Quarto to create reports for labs. This lets you keep everything in one place – no more running code, saving a figure to Downloads, copying into Word, then trying to remember where to paste the figure when you update the code.\n\n\nVS Code\nVS Code is a text editor. If you are an advanced user of another text editor, you can use that instead. However, VS Code is very nearly an officially supported IDE for Julia."

    "section": "Toolkit: Installation",
    "text": "Toolkit: Installation\nThis section will walk you through the installation of the tools we will use in this project, step by step. It is recommended that you complete these steps in the order provided.\n\nInstall Julia\nThe best way to install Julia is through the juliaup tool, which will let you easily manage versions in the future and works seamlessly with VS Code. The instructions can be found at the JuliaUp GitHub repository, but we will summarize them here.\nIf your computer uses Windows, you can install Juliaup from the Windows Store.\nIf you have a Mac, you need the XCode developer tools installed. Once you have done that, or if you are using Linux, open a terminal (such as the Terminal app) and enter:\ncurl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh\nOnce you install Juliaup, install Julia version 1.11 by opening a terminal (in MacOS or Linux) or the command line (in Windows) and entering:\njuliaup add 1.11\njuliaup default 1.11\nThis will install Julia 1.11 and make it the default version. Going forward, if you want to add new versions or change the default, you can follow the Juliaup instructions.\n\n\nInstall VS Code\nVS Code is as close to an officially supported editor for Julia as you can get. We will follow this guide for setting up VS Code with Julia.\n\nYou can skip this section if you are an experienced programmer and already have a preferred IDE. Your IDE will likely have instructions for Julia and Quarto setup.\n\nYou can download VS Code here; open the downloaded file to install. Make sure to select the correct version for your operating system. If you have a newish Apple mac (with M1, M2, or M3 chip), make sure to check whether you have an Intel or Apple chip before choosing which version to download. You can also use homebrew or your preferred package manager to install VS Code.\n\nVS Code Julia Extension\nLike many IDEs, VS Code is a modular system that can be extended with plugins. We will install the Julia extension, which will allow us to run Julia code and interact with the Julia REPL from within VS Code (we’ll add the Quarto extension later).\n\nOpen VS Code.\nSelect View and click Extensions to open the Extension View.\nSearch for julia in the search box. Click the green install button.\nRestart VS Code once the installation is complete. It should automatically find your Julia installation; reach out if not.\n\nThe Julia VS Code extension offers you some nice features. You can start a REPL (an interactive Julia coding environment) by opening the “Command Palette” (View -&gt; Command Palette, or CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+P) and typing “REPL” to bring up “Julia: Start REPL”. You can also create .jl and .qmd files to write Julia code and execute line by line.\n\n\n\nGitHub\nSee GitHub official tutorials for more helpful resources and tutorials.\n\nCreate GitHub Account\nIf you already have a GitHub account, you can use that for this course and do not need to create a new account. Otherwise, create an account. It doesn’t have to be linked to your Rice email or your NetID.\nFor labs and projects, you should use the GitHub Classroom link posted on Canvas to “accept” the assignment, which will give you your own GitHub repository for that assignment. The first time you click one of these links, you will need to link your place on the course roster with your GitHub account.\n\n\nGitHub Desktop (Optional)\nYou can do everything that you will need to do for this course with GitHub directly through VS Code. The GitHub desktop app is also great, or alternatively you may work directly through the terminal if you have prior experience.\n\n\n\nGitHub Copilot (Optional)\nGitHub Copilot is an AI-powered tool that helps you write code. You can install it following instructions here As described in the quickstart guide, Copilot is free for students. Be sure to review the policy on AI language models in the syllabus!\n\n\nInstall Quarto\nQuarto combines the best of Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown to create a document format that is ideal for conducting and communicating data science. We will use Quarto to create and share our work in this course; this website is also built using Quarto.||\nFollow the documentation to install Quarto. Be sure to ensure that you have the right version for your operating system.\n\nInstall the Quarto Extension for VS Code\nUnder “Step 2”, click on the VS Code icon.\n\n\nInstall Jupyter\nUnder the hood, Quarto uses a tool called Jupyter to run code. You don’t need to know how Jupyter works or worry about it, because it runs under the hood, but we will need to install it. Jupyter is a Python package.\nIf you don’t have Python installed (if you’re not sure, you should install Miniconda below), you’ll need to install it. The best way, by far, is to install Miniconda (see Conda documentation).\nOnce you have Python installed, you can open your Terminal (open VS Code then open the terminal), then run\npython3 -m pip install jupyter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on past experience, getting Jupyter installed and Quarto to find your Jupyter installation is the most common source of problems, especially on Windows machines. Please start this early and use Canvas discussions if you have any trouble."
