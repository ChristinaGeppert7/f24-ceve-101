# Decision Theory

## Goals

We want to compare alternatives $a$ in some set of possible alternatives $\mathcal{A}$

::: {.incremental}
- Pick the best one
- Inform others about trade-offs
- Learn about the true nature of the problem
:::

## Rationality

::: {.incremental}
1. Utility is the value of a choice, in abstract units. More utility is better.
1. Axioms of rationality:
    - Completeness: For any pair of alternatives $a_i$ and $a_j \in \mathcal{A}$, either $a_i \geq a_j$ or $a_j \geq a_i$ or both.
    - Transitivity: If $a_i \geq a_j$ and $a_j \geq a_k$, then $a_i \geq a_k$.
    - Independence: If $a_i \geq a_j$, then for any $a_k$, $a_i + a_k \geq a_j + a_k$.

Illustrating example: do I prefer tea to coffee?

## The World is Uncertain

::: {.callout-tip}
## Breakout

If we are evaluating whether a proposed bridge is a good investment, what are some factors that might impact the utility of each alternative?
:::

::: {.incremental}
1. We consider many *states of the world* $s \in \mathcal{S}$
1. We use probabilities to quantify our uncertainty: $p(s)$
1. Utility depends on the state of the world: $u(a, s)$
:::

## Expected Utility

::: {.incremental}
1. We can calculate the *expected utility* of an alternative $a$ as:
$$
u(a) = \mathbb{E}[u(a, s)] = \int_{s \in \mathcal{S}} u(a, s) p(s)
$$
1. Idealized rational decision-makers behave as though they are maximizing utility [@@savage_foundations:1954], though this is not a good description of actual human behavior [@ellsberg_ambiguity:1961]

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

## Objectives

::: {.incremental}
1. Compare multiple alternatives on an "apples-to-apples" basis
    - Often, using money as the common denominator
1. Make underlying assumptions explicit
:::

## Many Engineering Decisions Involve Time

::: {.incremental}
1. When building infrastructure, costs and benefits often occur at different times
    - Costs now, benefits later
1. Money now is more valuable than money later
    - Opportunity cost of capital
    - People in the future will be richer
    - Uncertainty, which many people dislike, grows with time
:::

## Net Present Value

Put all costs and benefits into a common unit (typically present dollars)

::: {.fragment}
$$
\text{NPV}(a) = \sum_{t=0}^T (1 - \gamma)^t u(a)
$$
where $\gamma$ is the *discount rate*
:::
::: {.fragment}
$$
\text{NPV}(a) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^T (1 - \gamma)^t u(a, s_t) \right]
$$
:::

## Optimization

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
We can define the *best* alternative as
$$
a^* = \arg \max_a \text{NPV}(a)
$$

There are many algorithms and solution techniques, depending on the problem.
:::


::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}

```{julia}
#| echo: false

x = (-2π):0.005:(2π)
f(x) = sin(x) + x + 0.1x^2 + cos(x)
y = f.(x)

fig, ax = plot(x, y; label=L"$a \in \mathcal{A}$")
min_y = minimum(y)
min_x = x[argmin(y)]
scatter!(ax, [min_x], [min_y]; color=:red, markersize=20, label=L"a^*")
ax.xlabel = L"$a$"
ax.ylabel = L"$\mathbb{E}[u(a)]$"
axislegend(ax; position=:lt)

# Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis

## Many Costs and Benefits are Difficult to Monetize

::: {.callout-tip}
## Breakout

What are some costs and benefits that are difficult to monetize?
:::

::: {.incremental}
1. Value of ecosystems
1. Health and safety
1. Aesthetics
1. Social and cultural values
:::

## Rubrics {.smaller}

| Category | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|----------|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| Environmental Impact | Severe negative impact | Moderate negative impact | Minimal impact | Positive impact |
| Cost Efficiency | Greatly exceeds budget | Slightly over budget | Within budget | Under budget |
| Community Benefit | No benefit | Minor benefit | Moderate benefit | Significant benefit |
| Technical Feasibility | Not feasible | Challenging but possible | Feasible with effort | Easily implementable |
| Long-term Sustainability | Not sustainable | Sustainable for <5 years | Sustainable for 5-10 years | Sustainable for >10 years |

## Pitfalls

::: {.incremental}
1. Rubrics can be highly subjective *in unclear ways*
    - Objectivity is a good aim, but not attainable -- be transparent
1. Arbitrary weights and criteria
:::

## Multiobjective Optimization

Rather than find a single best alternative, map trade-offs between multiple *objective functions*

## Project 2

Use a multi-criteria rubric to evaluate your proposed transportation improvements

- Justify your criteria and weights
- Use the rubric to evaluate alternatives
- Justify your scoring
