# About Civil and Environmental Engineering

## What problems have Civil and Environmental Engineers solved?

In small groups:

1. Discuss this question

:::

::: {.notes}
- In 1854, a severe cholera outbreak hit Soho, London, killing 616 people
- Dr. John Snow, a physician, suspected contaminated water was the cause, not "miasma" (bad air) as commonly believed
- He created a map marking cholera cases and water pumps in the area
- The map showed a cluster of cases around the Broad Street pump
- Snow had the pump handle removed, and new cases declined dramatically
- Epidemiology, clean water, sanitation, data visualization, spatial analysis
:::

## Clean Drinking Water

::: {.notes}
- Segovia aqueduct: Built 1st century CE, 813 meters long, 28.5 meters high, without mortar
- Roman aqueducts transported clean water to cities, improving sanitation and public health
- Demonstrates advanced Roman civil engineering, some still functional after 2000 years
- Aqueducts like this laid the foundation for modern urban water supply systems

:::

## Decaying Infrastructure

![](https://i.redd.it/dby0crkfspr31.jpg){height=580px}

::: {.notes}
- Aging infrastructure is a global and national problem
- Maintenance and replacement costs are huge challenges
- CEVE plays a crucial role through:
  - Optimizing infrastructure upgrade prioritization
  - Developing advanced materials for longer-lasting structures
  - Designing more durable and efficient road systems
  - Improving asset management and maintenance strategies
  - Implementing smart sensing technologies for real-time monitoring
  - Innovating sustainable and resilient infrastructure solutions
:::

## Inadequate Infrastructure

:::

## Unequal Burdens

![](https://api.understandinghouston.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-Temperature.jpg){height=580px}

::: {.notes}
- Urban heat islands disproportionately affect low-income neighborhoods, leading to health risks and higher energy costs
- CEVE addresses these issues through urban planning, green infrastructure, and equitable policy recommendations
:::

## Water Pollution

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Toxic_Algae_Bloom_in_Lake_Erie.jpg/2560px-Toxic_Algae_Bloom_in_Lake_Erie.jpg){height=580px}

::: {.notes}
- Algal blooms in Lake Erie are caused by excess nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) from agricultural runoff and sewage
- These blooms can produce toxins harmful to humans and animals, and deplete oxygen in the water, leading to fish die-offs
- CEVE addresses this through improved wastewater treatment, sustainable agricultural practices, and ecosystem restoration techniques
:::

## Residual Risk

![](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-08-15T020705Z_1173683348_RC2E5P9KWO4T_RTRMADP_3_HAITI-QUAKE.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80){height=580px}

::: {.notes}
- The image shows the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in Haiti, highlighting the vulnerability of infrastructure in developing countries
- There are cost-reliability trade-offs in earthquake-resistant design, but similar or stronger earthquakes in more developed countries (e.g., Chile) have resulted in fewer casualties, emphasizing the importance of proper building codes and their implementation
- CEVE addresses this challenge through developing cost-effective earthquake-resistant designs, collaborating on building code implementation, and integrating socioeconomic factors into resilience planning
- This issue requires an interdisciplinary approach, combining structural engineering, urban planning, policy development, and economic considerations to create comprehensive solutions for earthquake resilience
:::

## Impacts on Community, Health, and Economy

![](outside-they-built.png){height=580px}

::: {.notes}
- CEVEs design the built environment, which has far-reaching impacts on society
- The design of infrastructure affects public health outcomes, such as air quality and access to green spaces
- Built environments shape community interactions and economic activity, influencing quality of life
- Infrastructure decisions have long-term implications for tax burdens and municipal budgets
