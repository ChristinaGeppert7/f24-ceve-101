Doubling CO2 leads to $\approx 3^\circ$ C of warming ("[climate sensitivity](https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2_data_mlo.png)")

## CO2 emissions over time

## Rates and stocks

- Temperature depends on atmospheric concentration
- Emissions are the *rate* at which greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere
- Concentrations are the *stock* of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
- CO2 and other greenhouse gases are long-lived in the atmosphere

## Origin of fossil fuels {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/images/OILGASFORMATION.gif)

### Gas
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

### Oil

1. Plants and animals die and sink to the bottom of the sea
2. The plant and animal layer gets covered with mud
3. Over time, more sediment exerts pressure, compressing the dead plants and animals into oil
4. Oil moves up through porous rocks and eventually forms a reservoir

:::
::::
1. Anaerobic decomposition of microorganisms (e.g., phytoplankton and zooplankton) under anoxic conditions
2. Over geologically long duration, high levels of heat and pressure caused the organic matter to chemically alter into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons

## Origin of fossil fuels (cont.) {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/coal/images/coalformation.jpg)

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

### Coal

1. Vegetation were gradually compressed as they get buried under soil, rising the temperature and pressure
2. The plant matter was protected from biodegradation and oxidation, usually by mud or acidic water, and the dead vegetation was slowly converted, by carbonization, to coal
:::

## Global coal reserves

## Global oil reserves

::: {.notes}
Important to note that for oil, the idea of proven reserves is a bit misleading since technology improves access to and discovery of previously inaccessible reserves.

# Electricity Systems Focus

## Electrification: Key to Mitigation

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Electrification is crucial for climate change mitigation
- Renewable electricity can replace fossil fuels in many sectors
- Enables use of clean energy sources across the economy
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Transportation: Electric vehicles
- Heating: Heat pumps
- Industry: Electric furnaces and processes
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
- Discuss the concept of primary energy and its limitations
- Explain how electrification can lead to overall energy efficiency improvements
- Highlight the importance of clean electricity generation for effective electrification
:::

## Energy Efficiency and Primary Energy

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Primary energy: Total energy content of fuel before conversion
- Final energy: Energy delivered to end-users
- Efficiency in conversion and use is crucial
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Renewables replace the *work* done by fossil fuels, not total primary energy
- Higher efficiency of electric systems means less primary energy needed
- Example: Electric vehicles vs. internal combustion engines
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
- Discuss how the concept of primary energy can be misleading when comparing fossil fuels to renewables
- Explain how improved efficiency in electrified systems can lead to lower overall energy consumption
- Provide examples of efficiency gains through electrification in various sectors
:::

## Carbon intensity of electricity

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/solar-pv-prices-vs-cumulative-capacity_1998.png)
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
- Solar PV module prices declined exponentially
- Learning rate for solar PV modules: 20.2%
- Price declined from $106 to $0.38 per watt (99.6% decrease)
:::
:::

## Learning curves in renewable energy

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Solar electricity prices follow learning curves
- Learning rate for solar electricity: 36%
- Wind power also shows strong learning effects
