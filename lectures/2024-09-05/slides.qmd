# Climate Change and $\text{CO}_2$

## Emissions: rate of change

::: {.incremental}
- Temperature depends on atmospheric concentration ("climate sensitivity")
- Emissions are the *rate* at which greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere
- Greenhouse gases leave the atmosphere through biological (e.g., photosynthesis) and physical (e.g., equilibrium with the ocean) processes
- Imbalance when emissions exceed sinks
:::

## Climate sensitivity

Climate sensitivity is the equilibrium change in global temperature for a doubling of $\text{CO}_2$ concentrations.

- With no feedback effects at all, about $1^\circ$ C
    - Both positive and negative feedbacks
- Doubling CO2 leads to $\approx 3^\circ$ C of warming ("[climate sensitivity](https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2_data_mlo.png)")
    - But values between 1.5 and 4.5 C are plausible

## Origin of fossil fuels {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/images/OILGASFORMATION.gif)

### Gas
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

### Oil

1. Plants and animals die and sink to the bottom of the sea
2. The plant and animal layer gets covered with mud
3. Over time, more sediment exerts pressure, compressing the dead plants and animals into oil
4. Oil moves up through porous rocks and eventually forms a reservoir

:::
::::
1. Anaerobic decomposition of microorganisms (e.g., phytoplankton and zooplankton) under anoxic conditions
2. Over geologically long duration, high levels of heat and pressure caused the organic matter to chemically alter into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons

## Origin of fossil fuels (cont.) {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/coal/images/coalformation.jpg)

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

### Coal

1. Vegetation was gradually compressed as they get buried under soil, rising the temperature and pressure
2. The plant matter was protected from biodegradation and oxidation, usually by mud or acidic water, and the dead vegetation was slowly converted, by carbonization, to coal
:::
::::

## Global coal reserves

::: {.notes}
Important to note that for oil, the idea of proven reserves is a bit misleading since technology improves access to and discovery of previously inaccessible reserves.

## Triple renewable capacity

![Global renewables power capacity in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, 2022 and 2030](./iea-renewable-capacity.png)


## Where do these estimates come from? {.smaller}

Example: IEA's [Net-Zero by 2050 Roadmap](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050).


1. **Scenario Development** : Multiple global policy and socioeconomic storylines
2. **Energy System Modeling** : Detailed analysis of energy production, consumption, and technologies
3. **Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs)** : Economic and emissions impacts of scenarios
4. **Climate Models** : Temperature projections based on emissions scenarios
5. **Technology Pathways** : Analysis of technology development and deployment

::: {.callout-note}
Note: Most models have limited feedback from climate to economics/policy
:::

## Some definitions

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Primary energy:** Total energy content of fuel before conversion
- **Final energy:** Energy delivered to end-users
- **Efficiency in conversion and use is crucial**
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Renewables replace the **work** done by fossil fuels, not total primary energy
- Higher **efficiency** of electric systems means less primary energy needed
- Example: Electric vehicles vs. internal combustion engines
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
- Discuss how the concept of primary energy can be misleading when comparing fossil fuels to renewables
- Explain how improved efficiency in electrified systems can lead to lower overall energy consumption
- Provide examples of efficiency gains through electrification in various sectors
