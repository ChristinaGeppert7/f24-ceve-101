## Questions to consider

- What is the specific problem for which the proposed solution is intended? How does it relate to broader (and harder to pin down) goals?
- What external factors (e.g., abundant clean electricity?) are necessary for the solution to succeed?
- In a best-case scenario, how much impact could the solution have on global climate?
- What are the main technical, economic, and policy impediments to the solution's success?

## Topics

Listen to / read the articles your team members have chosen and read their one-pagers.
Then, as a group, choose a topic.

::: {.incremental}
- Should be an innovative idea that changes something about the energy system
- May be a business model, technology, product, policy, etc.
:::

## Problem statement

::: {.incremental}
- Does not have to be energy related -- environmental, health, social, etc.
- Should be clearly defined.
- Think critically; the problem statement often defines the solution
