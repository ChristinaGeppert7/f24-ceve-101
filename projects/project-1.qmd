A large agricultural processing operation, CEVE101 Inc., located near Houston, TX, is considering installing an on-site power generator.
Their goal is to be self-reliant on locally produced energy, but to still be connected to the regional power grid.
They can sell surplus power to the grid at 75% of the current wholesale price.

They use electricity in their factory operations that run from 9 AM to 5 PM during weekdays (they donâ€™t take holidays), and also for powering offices and other buildings associated with their operation.
Their electric demand is approximately 50 MW during the 9-5 weekday peak, and only 5 MW during off-peak.
They can purchase electricity from the grid at wholesale prices, which are currently at 5 c/kWh during the off-peak period, and at 15 c/kWh during the peak period.

Your task is to conduct an alternatives analysis to determine the best option for CEVE101 Inc. to meet their electricity needs.
