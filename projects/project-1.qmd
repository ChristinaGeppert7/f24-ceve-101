The Energy Transition is a rapidly accelerating global trend that promises tremendous social, economic, and environmental benefits but that also poses significant challenges.
A plethora of technological, policy, and business model innovations are being developed to facilitate the transition to a more sustainable energy system.
A key challenge for observers and decision-makers is to separate the hype from the reality and to identify the most promising pathways to a sustainable energy future.

In this project, you will sign research a specific proposed solution to the energy transition and evaluate its potential to contribute to a sustainable energy future.
You will first find a promising solution to research -- good places to start are interviews with founders from podcasts such as [Volts](https://www.volts.wtf/) or [Catalyst](https://www.canarymedia.com/podcasts/catalyst-with-shayle-kann).
You will then provide a critical assessment of the solution, relying on more balanced and nuanced sources.
Critical questions to answer are the following:

- What is the specific problem for which the proposed solution is intended? How does it relate to broader (and harder to pin down) goals?
- What external factors (e.g., abundant clean electricity?) are necessary for the solution to succeed?
- In a best-case scenario, how much impact could the solution have on global climate?
- What are the main technical, economic, and policy impediments to the solution's success?

You will work in small groups and submit a written report.
